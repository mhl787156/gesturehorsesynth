# gesturehorsesynth
A gesture controlled synthesizer using sonic-pi, a raspberry pi, leap motion, python-sonic, an ultrasound sensor and lots of buttons!

It comprises of 2 parts, the backing track creater in which you could use the ultrasound sensor to record and loop a backing track. We had a button for switching to different synthesizers, and you could have multiple backing tracks, all synced up to one another.
And the second part which comprised of a leap motion which you could control the note pitch by height, synthesiser by hand roll, and volume by hand pitch. We designed the notes like a harp so that instead of being chromatic motion, it would play modal motions and the mode would change on a button press.

The sound was created using sonic-pi with python-sonic bindings!

Created for the Imperial College Robotics Hackathon 2016 on the theme of 'Interact' 

This project won the prize for best project of the hackathon!
